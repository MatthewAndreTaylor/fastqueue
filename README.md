Single ended fast queue's built in C tuned for python.

## Requirements

- `python 3.9+`

## Installation

To install fastqueue, using pip:

```bash
pip install fastqueue-lib
```

## Quickstart

For general use cases `fastqueue.Queue()` objects are tuned to perform well.
The enqueue and dequeue methods perform well over a large sequence of arbitrary operations.
`fastqueue.Queue()` supports many standard sequence methods similar to lists.
`fastqueue.Queue()` minimizes memory usage but maintains the fast queue speeds.

```py
>>> from fastqueue import Queue
>>> queue = Queue()
>>> queue.extend(['ðŸš’', 'ðŸ›´'])
>>> queue[0]
'ðŸš’'
>>> 'ðŸ›´' in queue
True
>>> queue.enqueue('ðŸš…')
>>> queue.enqueue('ðŸš—')
>>> queue[-1]
'ðŸš—'
>>> [queue.dequeue() for _ in range(len(queue)) ]
['ðŸš’', 'ðŸ›´', 'ðŸš…', 'ðŸš—']
```


For more specialized cases `fastqueue.QueueC()` objects are tuned to perform well.
The interface for `fastqueue.QueueC()` is identical to `fastqueue.Queue()`.
The enqueue and dequeue methods perform similarly well over a large sequence of arbitrary operations.
`fastqueue.QueueC()` handles memory differently by doubling the capacity when full.
This increases the complexity but maintains fast amortized cost.
The benefit of this approach is even faster `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` speeds

```py
>>> from fastqueue import QueueC
>>> queue_c = QueueC()
>>> queue_c.extend(['ðŸš’', 'ðŸ›´'])
>>> queue_c[0]
'ðŸš’'
>>> 'ðŸ›´' in queue_c
True
>>> queue_c.enqueue('ðŸš…')
>>> queue_c.enqueue('ðŸš—')
>>> queue_c[-1]
'ðŸš—'
>>> [queue_c.dequeue() for _ in range(len(queue_c)) ]
['ðŸš’', 'ðŸ›´', 'ðŸš…', 'ðŸš—']
```

Another alternative is `fastqueue.LockQueue()` which supports all queue operations.
`fastqueue.LockQueue()` is built as a thread-safe alternative to the other queue types.
